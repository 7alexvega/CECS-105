        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. My name is Alexander Vega and I am a freshman at CSULB studying Computer Science. I was first introduced to computer science during high-school where I enrolled in AP Computer Science. Despite not having prior knowledge in the subject, I was always interested in computers and curious to figure out how they worked. Over the course I learned the fundamentals of programming using Java by writing software to accomplish basic tasks. While the programs I wrote in class were interesting, I had a further desire to apply what I learned to solve problems in my everyday life.
I took what I had learned in class and continued to seek additional resources to learn how to create a mobile application as a personal project. I learn best through hands-on work, so after reading a few tutorials and completing walk-throughs, I set out to create my own application that would help myself and others learn the fundamentals of music theory. I am always learning better practices as I take more courses and further delve into material. While I do so I am continuosly updateing my app to reflect the state of my learning.
